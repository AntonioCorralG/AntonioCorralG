👋 Hi there! I'm Gonzalo, a front-end engineer passionate about creating accessible and beautiful web experiences.
🎨 I specialize in:

React & TypeScript
Accessibility-first development
Responsive design
Turning Figma designs into pixel-perfect interfaces

🌱 My journey to tech is unique - I started as an educator, which taught me the importance of inclusive design and clear communication. Now as an engineer at Intuit, I get to combine my teaching background with my love for coding to build better user experiences.
💡 I'm particularly interested in:

Design systems
Web accessibility (WCAG)
Modern front-end frameworks
User-centered development

🔍 Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge of computer science fundamentals through Harvard Extension School's Frontend Development program.
